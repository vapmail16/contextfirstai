Please look at the documents which are there in the project folder in the docs folder. So basically initial requirements is where I have the requirements and then second is the guidelines document, checklist document, issue log, and deployment issue log. These are all the lessons learned. These are all the documents which we need to consider while creating this application. First and most important thing is we need to create this application using EDD which is test driven development. So write in your guidelines, make sure that you follow this approach every time you build or create. Second thing is if you go up the root level, you will see two folders. One is standards and one is template. In standards folder, there's another folder called frontend. You can check the actual name. So I want the frontend like that. And secondly, if you go to template, you will see a backend template created which has authentication, SMTP, payment gateway, and GDPR. I want that entire template to be copied, a database to be created, and then the migration should happen from that to the new application level database. And then run the test cases to confirm whether the backend and frontend are able to build, and then we can build the actual functional which are in their initial requirements document.
